/**
 * All files in this package is copied from https://github.com/amedia/freemarker-java-8. It is only used in the
 * spark demo server for FreeMarker templates. The freemarker-java-8 library is at the moment not public available in
 * the Maven Central. So a copy seemed fair within only the demo part of the Meteo Library. If freemarer-java-8 are
 * ever made public available or FreeMarker natively will support the java.time API, then we will remove these classes
 * as well.
