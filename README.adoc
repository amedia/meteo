# METEO

Meteo is mainly a Java client that can fetch Weather data from the http://api.met.no.
But Meteo also offers an extra library (meteo-extras) that can help you create those nice weather reports for your
website.

Please note that Meteo is in no way affiliated with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute
except for the fact that we use their awesome API to provide you this client.


## IMPORTANT

Make sure to read the http://api.met.no/conditions_service.html[Conditions for use of the service] before you start
using Meteo. You must take care of the caching issues yourself. Meteo do not have a solution for this out of the box.

Also make sure to give credit to MET on your site or in you app : http://api.met.no/license_data.html
