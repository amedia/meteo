# METEO

Meteo is an Open-Source Java based project for dealing with weather data from http://api.met.no.
It mainly consists of two parts. A client and a helper library for converting the raw data into weather reports.

Please note that Meteo is in no way affiliated with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute
except for the fact that it use their awesome API to provide you with weather data.

## IMPORTANT

Make sure to read the http://api.met.no/conditions_service.html[Conditions for use of the service] from
the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. You must take care of the caching issues yourself.
Meteo does not have a solution for this out of the box. However, it is possible to create a client that respects the
cache headers quite easily (Maybe this will be added to Meteo later).

Also make sure to read this http://api.met.no/license_data.html.
